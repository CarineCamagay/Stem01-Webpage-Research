        <p> <font size="5"> Pearson correlation revealed a statistically high positive correlation between attitude and behavior (r=0.726; p=0.000), attitude and Perceived Closeness (r=0.738; p=0.000), and behavior and perceived closeness (r=0.664; p=0.000).

Perceived Closeness, Attitude, Behavior : SIGNIFICANT

        <p> <font size="5"> Our survey questionnaire focused on the positive side of the relationship between perceived closeness of family relationship, attitude, and behavior towards social media.	
Social media is not used by family members to express their love for their family .The use of social media helps families a lot in communicating, especially those who are away with their family members. However, it takes most of our time resulting to the lessening the time we are supposed to give to our family members. The likes and posts of family pictures, celebrations, and greetings on social media do not determine the quality of family relationship. Social media do not let family members feel closer to their family however it also do not destroy the quality of family relationships.
Confidential things are kept between family members, and feelings must be expressed personally not through social media in order to have strong and better family relationships.
Through the data analysis tables given, we have found out that perceived closeness of family relationship, attitude, and behavior towards the use of social media relates to each other.

        <p><font size="5"> Our research will be highly recommended and helpful for people who are fond of using social media; this may help raise awareness to have discipline when using the social media. 
For further research, we recommend that they may research on the negative sides since our study focuses on the positive side, also, for further research comparing or the comparison between use of social media on friendly relationships and family relationships.
